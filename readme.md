# GraphQL API Server

A simple GraphQL server built with Apollo Server that demonstrates the fundamentals of GraphQL API development.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST APIs.

### Key Features of GraphQL:

- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST which has multiple endpoints, GraphQL typically uses a single endpoint
- **Strongly Typed**: GraphQL has a type system that defines what data is available
- **Client-Specified Queries**: Clients can request exactly the data they need, nothing more, nothing less
- **Real-time Updates**: Built-in support for subscriptions and real-time data
